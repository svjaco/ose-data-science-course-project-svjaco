    "* Individual contributions that extend the paper are clearly indicated as such. In particular, figures and tables that constitute an independent contribution have the tag \"EXT\" in their name. For instance: \"Figure EXT_1\". Moreover, in Section [6](#Maimonides_rule_redux) we replicate relevant parts of a recent follow-up paper by the authors, \"Maimonides' rule redux\" (Angrist et al., [2019](#Angrist_2019)). For transparency these parts are tagged with \"MRR\", like in \"Figure MMR_1\".\n",
    "* For the replication of the regression estimation results we removed one observation in the sample of the 5th graders. The reason is that one class only took the reading test and thus has a missing value for the math score which caused problems with the programming for cluster correction. Instead of 2019 classes we use 2018 classes when estimations involve the average reading score. However, this has de facto no influence on the results. Estimated coefficients sometimes differ slightly at the third decimal place and standard errors are unchanged."

    "Class size reduction (CSR) is very popular among teachers and parents alike.\n",
    "The conventional belief is that smaller classes benefit children because it gives more time for a teacher to devote to each student.\n",
    "Also there may be fewer disruptions during lessons and teachers can more easily engage students in academic activities (Hattie, [2005](#Hattie_2005)).\n",
    "However, reducing class sizes is highly expensive. \n",
    "Additional classrooms have to be provided, but more importantly the newly hired teachers increase the total educational expenditures substantially.\n",
    "The CSR program enacted in California in 1996 had annually costs exceeding one billion dollars, 25000 new teaching positions had to be created in the first two years (Jepsen and Rivkin, [2009](#Jepsen_2009), p. 224).\n",
    "These teachers then also have to be equally qualified.\n",
    "Otherwise potential gains of smaller classes might be offset, as revealed in the case of California by Jepsen and Rivkin ([2009](#Jepsen_2009)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In view of the high costs with limited funding resources at the same time, empirical evidence for the consequences of changing class size is needed.\n",
    "The class size question is one of the central research questions in economics of education with several studies published over the years.\n",
    "Since class size is in general not randomly assigned but endogenous (correlated with unobserved characteristics of students and schools), causal effects of class size on achievement have proved very difficult to identify.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to address the issue of endogeneity/selection bias is to run a randomized experiment where children are randomly assigned to classes of different sizes.\n",
    "The most prominent example is the Tennessee Student/Teacher Achievement Ratio (STAR) experiment from the late eighties, for which post-analyses have found substantial positive effects of CSR (see Krueger ([1999](#Krueger_1999)), and Chetty et al. ([2011](#Chetty_2011)) for an evaluation of long-term impacts).\n",
    "Researcher-designed randomized experiments of class size, however, are rare.\n",
    "As mentioned above they involve large costs and besides may face political and ethical barriers.\n",
    "Therefore, research relies on natural experiments that create some kind of variation in class sizes.\n",
    "Over time corresponding studies have reported mixed results.\n",
    "Some find positive effects as in the STAR experiment (e. g., Gary-Bobo and Mahjoub, [2013](#Gary-Bobo_2013)), some find either no association (e. g., Hoxby, [2000](#Hoxby_2000)) or even larger classes being beneficial (Dobbelsteen et al., [2002](#Dobbelsteen_2002)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1999 Angrist and Lavy published a seminal paper in which they estimate the effect of class size on scholastic achievement, measured by standardized math and reading tests, in Israeli elementary schools.\n",
    "The authors were the first to recognize that mandatory class size caps might serve as a source of exogenous variation in class size.\n",
    "In Israel classes are capped at 40 students according to the so-called Maimonides rule, named after the medieval rabbinic scholar Maimonides.\n",
    "This rule induces a nonlinear and nonmonotonic relationship between grade enrollment and class size.\n",
    "That is, class size increases one-by-one with enrollment up to 40, but when 41 students are enrolled there are supposed to be two classes of sizes 20 and 21.\n",
    "The same applies for each multiple of 40 (e. g., 81 pupils are split into three classes at size 27).\n",
    "Angrist and Lavy ([1999](#Angrist_1999)) exploit these discontinuities in the enrollment-class-size-relationship to create instrumental variables (IV) estimates in a fuzzy regression discontinuity design (RDD).\n",
    "The RDD is fuzzy since the schools do not follow Maimonides' rule strictly.\n",
    "The estimates suggest that CSR induces a significant increase in test scores with an effect size at the lower range of the strong STAR findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a recently published paper (\"Maimonides' rule redux\", [2019](#Angrist_2019)) Angrist et al. revisit the original results and redo the analysis for more recent data with a larger sample size.\n",
    "The newer estimates show no evidence of class size effects.\n",
    "Additionally, the data reveal enrollment manipulation.\n",
    "Both findings cast doubt on the earlier inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of the notebook is as follows.\n",
    "The next section describes the Israeli test score data and its key variables.\n",
    "In Section [3](#Identification) we illustrate the authors' strategy to identify the causal effect of class size using the causal graph approach.\n",
    "Then, the empirical strategy is presented.\n",
    "In Section [5](#Replication_of_core_results) we replicate selected core results of the paper and examine their robustness in Section [6](#Maimonides_rule_redux).\n",
    "Finally, we critically assess the quality of Angrist and Lavy ([1999](#Angrist_1999)) and conclude in Section [7](#Critical_assessment_and_conclusion)."

    "Even though the question \"What is the effect of class size on student performance?\" at a first glance may appears simple to answer, past research has shown that capturing the net (causal) effect comes along with different issues of identification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental problem is that class size (the treatment) is not randomly assigned.\n",
    "Thus, classes of different sizes can be expected to differ considerably in their composition and a naïve comparison of achievement would not be valid for inference due to the selection bias.\n",
    "The selection bias is likely to happen in two ways:\n",
    "On the one hand, certain parents (e. g., more educated, ambitious and/or wealthier) may actively seek to place their children in schools offering smaller classes.\n",
    "On the other hand, principals tend to group the least able students into smaller classes (Cohen-Zada et al., [2013](#Cohen-Zada_2013)).\n",
    "In the first case we would observe spurious positive effects of smaller classes, in the latter spurious lower achievement.\n",
    "To credibly account for the selection bias, exogenous variation in class size is needed, i. e., variation that is beyond the control of any involved stakeholder (students, teachers and school administrators).\n",
    "Angrist and Lavy ([1999](#Angrist_1999)) rely on the Maimonides rule as the source of variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure [EXT_2a](#figure2_EXTa) summarizes the underlying identification strategy in the form of a causal graph.\n",
    "We can see that the effect of interest, class size on test score (the outcome), is confounded by two observables, total grade enrollment and socioeconomic status (measured as the share of disadvantaged students at school).\n",
    "The linkage between socioeconomic status and academic performance is well known in the literature (e. g., Saifi and Mehmood, [2011](#Saifi_2011)).\n",
    "Enrollment correlates with the outcome independently of its effect on class size as larger schools in Israel are more likely to be located in relatively prosperous urban centers with a better intake of students (Angrist and Lavy, [1999](#Angrist_1999), p. 544).\n",
    "Besides, the relationship between class size and achievement is due to further confounding factors, which are unobservable (e. g., innate ability or parental preferences for child education).\n",
    "Because conditioning allows to determine causal effects only in the presence of observed confounding, the backdoor criterion is not satisfied (open path: Class size $\\leftarrow$ Unobservables $\\rightarrow$ Test score) and the causal effect is not identifiable.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if Maimonides' rule constitutes a valid IV as argued by the authors, we can nevertheless identify the effect in the given setting. Note that, as apparent in Figure [EXT_2a](#figure2_EXTa), the instrument is conditional on enrollment.\n",
    "A valid IV has to fulfill two assumptions (see, e. g., Angrist and Pischke, [2009](#Angrist_2009), Chapter 4.1): Relevance and the exclusion restriction.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\enspace$ (i) Relevance: Maimonides' rule is correlated with class size, Corr( Maimonides' rule, Class size | Enrollment ) $\\neq$ 0 \n",
    "\n",
    "From the nature of the rule it is intuitive that actual class size is determined to some degree by the instrument.\n",
    "We will see later, graphically as well as quantitatively, that Maimonides' rule indeed creates a strong first stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\enspace$ (ii) Exclusion restriction: Maimonides' rule affects the score only through class size, in particular, Corr( Maimonides' rule, Unobservables | Enrollment ) $=$ 0\n",
    "\n",
    "The exclusion restriction cannot be tested with the data (e. g., Morgan and Winship, [2014](#Morgan_2014), Chapter 9).\n",
    "Therefore, it has to be argued verbally that Maimonides' rule does not cause achievement through another channel.\n",
    "Figure [EXT_2b](#figure2_EXTb) demonstrates a scenario where the instrument is correlated with unobservables.\n",
    "This can happen if enrollment (the running variable in the RDD) is manipulated and children are successfully placed in grade enrollments just above the cutoff.\n",
    "As a consequence, the former identification strategy would break down. \n",
    "Angrist and Lavy ([1999](#Angrist_1999)) argue that in practice there is no way for parents to predict enrollment by the time school starts when registering their child in school (p. 550).\n",
    "And even if, Israeli pupils must attend a school in their local registration area that typically includes only one religious and one secular school (p. 542).\n",
    "Still, it remains an untestable identifying assumption.\n",
    "We will investigate potential indication for a violation of the assumption in Section [6](#Maimonides_rule_redux). \n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, Angrist and Lavy ([1999](#Angrist_1999)) present a credible identification strategy to determine the causal effect of CSR."

    "This leads to a Two Stage Least Squares (2SLS) estimation strategy where IV estimates of Equation [(2)](#eq_2) exploit the sharp drops in Maimonides' rule.\n",
    "To identify the causal effect of class size any other effects of enrollment (the running variable) on test scores have to be controlled for.\n",
    "This is why Angrist and Lavy ([1999](#Angrist_1999)) include different smooth functions of enrollment in the estimation procedure (linear, quadratic and piecewise linear).\n",

    "Angrist and Lavy ([1999](#Angrist_1999)) assume that enrollment manipulation is not a real concern.\n",

    "And even if, Israeli pupils in general must attend a neighborhood school (Angrist and Lavy, [1999](#Angrist_1999), p. 542).\n",
    "Thus, parents would have to move to another school district or opt for private schooling.\n",
    "However, Otsu et al. ([2013](#Otsu_2013), Section 5) provide evidence for sorting around the first Maimonides cutoff.\n",
    "There appear to be too many schools with enrollment just above 40, producing two classes.\n",
    "Angrist and Lavy ([1999](#Angrist_1999)) focus on parents' behavior as a source of manipulation and do not take teachers and school officials into account.\n",

    "Moreover, they conduct a similar analysis for a more recent (2002–2011) and larger sample of Israeli fifth graders.\n",

    "Second, 2SLS estimates show no evidence of class size effects (precisely estimated zeros), regardless of whether originally reported enrollment or corrected enrollment is used.\n",

In particular, schools are warned not to move students between grades or to enroll those abroad in order to produce an additional class.

    "That said, a Maimonides research design has been applied by different scholars over the last two decades.\n",
    "For example, in France by Gary-Bobo and Mahjoub ([2013](#Gary-Bobo_2013)), in Poland by Jakubowski and Sakowski ([2006](#Jakubowski_2006)) or in Bolivia by Urquiola ([2006](#Urquiola_2006)).\n",
    "The identification strategy used by Angrist and Lavy ([1999](#Angrist_1999)) is unusual but at the same time clear and simple, leading naturally to 2SLS estimation.\n",
    "Methodologically, the study provides an example of how a fuzzy regression discontinuity can be analyzed in an IV framework.\n",
    "It is also worth to acknowledge that the authors revisit the results 20 years later to check their robustness thoroughly.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of the original paper is that manipulation of the running variable (grade enrollment) is only considered verbally and from the parents' perspective.\n",
    "Consequently, the authors fail to detect the manipulation at the first cutoff.\n",
    "Besides, as also acknowledged (Angrist and Lavy, [1999](#Angrist_1999), Section VI), the estimated effects are likely not one-to-one transferable to other countries because Israeli classes are large.\n",
    "The mean class size in the data is 30 with ten percent of classes having more than 37 pupils.\n",
    "Meta-results for Europe are weak and insignificant (e. g., Wößmann ([2005](#Wößmann_2005)) and Shen and Konstantopoulos ([2017](#Shen_2017))).\n",
    "Lastly, it appeared very reasonable to exclude the third graders from most of the analysis and interpretation.\n",
    "A formal investigation of a possible structural difference in the 3rd graders' test scores, unfortunately, cannot be undertaken as the test program only existed for the two years (1991–1992) and was then abandoned for political reasons.\n",
    "In hindsight, equipped with the new estimates from Angrist et al. ([2019](#Angrist_2019)), the zero-effect estimates for the third grade are noteworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, Angrist and Lavy ([1999](#Angrist_1999)) constitutes a seminal paper that majorly contributed to the CSR literature.\n",
    "The authors pioneered the use of legislative class size ceilings as a potential source of exogenous variation to credibly determine the causal effect of class size changes.\n",
    "This led to plenty of subsequent research.\n",
    "\n",
    "A possibly interesting future research direction is to study the effect of class size on academic achievement if teaching is conducted remotely. In particular, in which ways exactly a change in class size may impact on the performance compared to classroom teaching."

    "\n",
    "A comparison of the descriptive statistics between the grades shows that for both tests mean scores are substantially higher (see Figure [EXT_A1](#figureA1_EXT)) and standard deviations are lower for the third grade classes.\n",
